PassGuard : <br>
PassGuard is a lightweight password management application designed to provide users with a simple way to store and manage their passwords. It was developed as a learning project to explore basic web development concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

PassGuard utilizes the browser's local storage mechanism to store passwords. When a user saves a password, it is stored locally on their device using the localStorage API provided by modern web browsers.

  <br> 
  
PassGuard is built using the following technologies :  <br>
HTML:- Provides the structure and layout of the application.  <br>
CSS:- Styles the user interface to enhance usability and visual appeal.  <br>
JavaScript:- Implements the functionality for storing and managing passwords within the browser.  <br>    <br>
